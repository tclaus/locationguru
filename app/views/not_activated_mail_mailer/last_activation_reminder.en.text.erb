Hi,
your have an new entry on locationguru.net '<%= @location.listing_name %>' created.
But this entry is still not activated

Is there something we can do for you? Do we need to do something better?

Send a message to: support@locationguru.net

You can directly edit your entry here:

<%= listing_location_url(@location) %>

<%= render "html_helpers/mail_footer" %>
